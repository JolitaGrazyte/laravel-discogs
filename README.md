## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require jolitagrazyte/laravel-discogs
```

## Post-installation

You must set the service provider of this package in your application file.

``` php
// config/app.php
'provider' => [
    ...
    Jolita\LaravelDiscogs\DiscogsServiceProvider::class,
    ...
];
```

This package also comes with a facade, which provides an easy way to call the the class. 

``` php
// config/app.php
'aliases' => [
    ...
    'Discogs' => Jolita\LaravelDiscogs\DiscogsFacade::class,
    ...
];
```

Next up, you must publish the config file of this package with this command:

``` php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Jolita\LaravelDiscogs\DiscogsServiceProvider"
```

The following config file will be published in config/laravel-discogs.php

Some of the endpoints require authentication. 

If you want to use one of those you must set your token.

``` php

/*
 * Token is your discogs token that you can obtain on https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers page.
 * User-Agent is a name of your application, for example 'MyAmazingDiscogsApp/1.0'.
 *
 */
return [
    'token' => env('DISCOGS_TOKEN', ''),
    'headers' => [
        'User-Agent' => '',
    ],
];
```

## Usage

Usage of this package is really simple. 

For the most of the endpoints there is a method.

Optionally you can also use the get()-method.

### Endpoints with no authentication required

``` php
// Get artist where id is 1.
$artist = Discogs::artist('1');

// Request all the relases of the artist where id is 1.   
$artistRelease = Discogs::artistRelease('1');

// Get label where id is 1.
$label = Discogs::label('1');

// Request all the relases of the label where id is 1.
$labelRelease = Discogs::labelRelease('1');

// Get relase where id is 1.
$release = Discogs::release('1');

// Get listing where id is 1234.
$listing = Discogs::getMarketplaceListing('1234')

```
#### Inventory not authenticated

If you are not authenticated as the inventory owner, only items that have a status of For Sale will be visible.

```php
// Get inventory where username is username.
$inventory = Discogs::getUsersInventory('username')
```

### Endpoints where authentication is required

For the endpoints where authentication is required you must make sure that you have a token placed in your .env file or straight in the configuration file: config/laravel-discogs.php .

#### Orders 

```php
$myOrders = Discogs::getMyOrders();

// Get order with id 1234
$order = Discogs::orderWithId('1234');

// Get messages of the order with id 1234
$orderMessages = Discogs::orderMessages('1234')
```

#### Search

If you want to add some extra search parameters you can do it by first creating a SearchParameters object
and then chaining as many options as you want.

```php
// create a SearchParameters object
$searchParameters = new SearchParameters();

//chain some search paramater
$searchParameters->type('label')->format('lp')->year('1996');

//do a search request with query = 'MoWax' and passing the SearchParameters object
$searchResult = Discogs::search('MoWax', $searchParameters);
```

#### Inventory

When requesting your own inventory you also must authenticate. 

As the inventory owner you will get additional weight, format_quantity, external_id, and location keys.

```php
// Get inventory where username is username.
$inventory = Discogs::getUsersInventory('username')
```
